Pomodoro timer and task list manager, written in React. A best way to boost your productivity. Pomodoro time + Your personal working list + ReactJS My very efficient project named 'Pomodoro with list'. You can setup your own lists with time and just click start button -> it will run throught your list. Used ReactJS and little bit CSS with comportable colors.
